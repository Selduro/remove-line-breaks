# remove-line-breaks

This script is designed to remove line breaks from text copied to the clipboard via Ctrl + C, allowing for automatic adjustment to the target format when pasting, so that line breaks do not have to be removed manually afterward. The most common use case is likely copying text from a PDF into the ForumStar text system.
It should also remove automatic hyphenation in the source text (indicated by a line break immediately following a hyphen), so that hyphens do not have to be manually removed from the copied text.
